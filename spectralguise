[Sell][Priest]SpectralGuise
I have a BuG about the priest skill in the game andneed feedback.
When luse [Spectral Guise],even though I have a shield buff,but let's say 
I have a few dot's or damege debuffs on mel emerged from stealth before the shield was broken
This BuG affects the PVP experience too much,
l've been playing Shadow Priest for 17 years,l clearly
remember this ability only appearing when lactually took 3 damage.So l'm here to tell you about this BUG
This was fatal to us priests!
